### Rise and shine, kid.

The sound of people walking around outside of Albert and Jovan’s room, alongside Albert’s alarm clock immediately woke up the tired teen. He wiped his eyes and reached for his glasses, sitting straight on his bed in the process. He gets up and hits the top of his bunkbed, waking Jovan up.

“Jov, wake up. We’re going to be late and I can’t afford to get a late pass.”

Albert was a top ranking student in his grade and had to keep up with a good academic rep, since he was a part of the student council as well.

“5 more minutes, Bert.” Jovan grumbles while tossing and turning.

Albert gives up and just goes to his bathroom to get ready instead. Albert dries his hair and throws his wet towel over Jovan’s top bunk, startling Jovan and not realising he was already awake and on his phone.

“The fuck was that for, asshole?!” Jovan climbs down his bunk bed and throws the towel back to Albert.

“It’s your own fault for waking up late. The hell were you doing on your phone till 2 a.m. anyways?” Albert says with a little smirk on his face.

“None of your business, Mr. student council top ranking nerd.”
The two laugh it off and Jovan gets ready in the bathroom while Albert fixes his tie and places his books into his bag, not realising which books he brought. He zips up his backpack and gets out of their room, going to the dinner table and eating the leftover pizza slices they had the other day. After a few minutes of eating and getting ready, everyone was ready to go.

“Alright everyone, make sure to not leave anything behind. Now let’s go!” Jason yells.

The others were either on their phone, looking at their notes, or joking with their siblings. Albert was a bit stressed, though. He looked over his school schedules and student council schedules and saw he had no time to play with Jovan in the sports field next to their school. He sighed and looked out the window, putting on his headphones and thinking about how he just wants to rest. Hopefully the day won’t be as hectic as he thinks.

### Whose textbook is this?

Jovan and Albert were dropped off at their school and ran to classes without saying an “I love you” to Jason before leaving. They had 5 minutes to get to classes and thankfully got there 2 minutes before the bell. Albert’s class was across Jovan’s and they both said goodbye before shutting the class doors. Albert’s first session was science and pulled out his science workbook. He flipped to page 269 but saw that his answers weren’t written.

“Why is it empty? I did everything last night!” Albert thought to himself. He closed the book and saw he accidentally took Jovan’s book. Albert started to panic and ran across to Jovan’s class, yelling at him to check his bag. Thankfully, Jovan’s teacher wasn’t there yet and gave Albert’s workbook quickly. Albert went back into his class and sat down, sighing loudly after getting his book back.

“You okay, Bert?” Jayden asked, sitting next to him.

“I’m fine, I just thought I lost my homework from last night. Thank God Jovan has Science as well today.” Albert says calmly while his heart was still pacing.

The day continued after Science, then Mathematics, then a surprisingly peaceful lunch with no disturbances, which gave Albert some time to revise his Civic notes and write down some ideas for the student council meeting he has to attend after school to discuss an event coming up in a few months. Albert usually sat with Jayden and Jovan, but Jayden was sitting with his group to discuss about a group work for Social Studies and Jovan had to go to the chemistry lab for some consultation on a practicum. Albert finished lunch early and went to the library instead, going into one of the private rooms to practice his proposal for the meeting. The bell rang and Albert packed up his books to get to the last class of the day, Civics. Class finally ended and Jovan approached Albert to ask about their plan to play in the school basketball field.

### It's been a long day

Everyone finished dinner and forgot about the conversation earlier. Albert placed his plate in the sink and went to his room, dimming the lights and turning on his desk lamp to study. He had some History homework to finish and put on his headphones so he wouldn’t get distracted. It was almost 9 p.m. and Jason was tucking everyone to bed, even though Albert asked for 30 more minutes to revise his Chemistry notes.

“Sleeping late will make you fall asleep in class, it’s better to revise them tomorrow. Good night, Bert.”

“Fine, thankfully I don’t have a test tomorrow.”

Albert cleaned up his books, charged his laptop and turned off the lights. He gets into bed and texts the family group chat ‘Goodnight’ before dozing off.

Let’s see what tomorrow has in store for us.

### Good morning, lads!

The day begins with Jason opening the door and calling everyone to get up. Evan, with his eyes barely opened covers his head with his pillow. Before he could fall asleep, he gets tickled by Jason and is awoken, really pissed though.

He finally manages to gather enough strength to get up and shower, and gets dressed in his school uniform in a rush. "Beau'iful day today, innit?", he says while mocking the British accent. The others just raise an eyebrow at him, in confusion.

Evan packs his bag in a hurry, and goes downstairs to eat the slice of left-over pizza. He takes a quick look at his notes while waiting for Tim to start up the car; he has a big test today and he wants to make sure he's prepared. At last, he finally gets ready for school and puts on his shoes.

### A stressful test awaits

He enters the class and he is swarmed by people asking for yesterday's homework answers. Being the goody two shoes he is, he turns down everyone. School starts with a boring literature class, where everyone's literally distracted. The teacher relies on Evan make everyone pay attentionn, although he doesn't seem to bother doing so.

The test begins, everyone sweats off struggles while Evan scans through with a breeze and pass with flying colours. As usual, Evan gets the award for the top student. Feeling great, he goes calling everyone having a major skill issue, like the brat he is.

### Nom-nom-nom time

Lunch break comes. A group of people approach him and pins him to the seat. They tease him and threatens to hurt him if he doesn't handover his notes for tommorow's

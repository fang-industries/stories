### An exciting morning

It's 5:45 AM. The morning starts with Jason barging into the room and telling everyone to wake up. She gets up immediately and goes to the bathroom and takes a shower. She puts on her clothes and goes down for breakfast. It's a slice of left-over pizza. She goes back to her room and packs up her bag for today.

As she waits for everyone else to get ready, she watches the sunrise from Tim's car. A great day awaits her today. Everyone eventually gets ready and gets on the car, and Tim drops Bri and Evan at school.

"I'll see you after school.", said Evan.

They both split ways and go to their individual classes. There, she was greeted by Cha, her best friend. She puts her bag down and talks to her about the upcoming day today. Bri is really excited for today; it's her friends birthday and she gets the chance to present an embarrassing presentation for her friend.

The school bell rings! It's time for school! She gets to her first lesson, Social Studies.

"Ughhh, soclal studies.", her classmates groaned.

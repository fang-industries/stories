*show drone footage of Taman Anggrek with a dramatic title*

Jason: *walks into the set and sits on the chair, adjusting his shirt after sitting down.*

Director: “Are you sure you’re ready to tell your story?”
 
Jason: Yeah, it’s better if I actually address this story, instead of letting rumours continue and worsen the situation. 

Director: *clapperboard claps twice*

## SCENE A - INTRODUCTIONS

Jason: I can remember it as if it was yesterday - because it was.

December 19th, 2022. It was a nice Monday outing. I was actually on school holidays and had just gotten home from a trip to the mall with a few of my friends.

Prior to this, I had actually been getting close to this one girl. On the 19th, the day of the trip to the mall, I had become even closer to her when hanging out, you could say I got a bit too clingy with her.

The day after though, when I was blinded with bliss, she texted me that there were rumours of the two of us swirling around about how we were in love with each other, and that I got too clingy on the trip. That all happened at 9:42 p.m.

Quite possibly, the last time this relationship would stay as a secret.

## SCENE B - TIME-FRAME

Cinta: If I remember correctly, I took a break from skating at around 3:16 p.m. and sat next to Nadine and Jason in the rest area, where he laid his head on my shoulder. I didn’t think much of it so I went back to the skating rink after a few minutes. (3:48 p.m)

*add a couple flashing images of Jason being clingy to Cinta*

Cinta: Someone must’ve noticed him being clingy to me. But the question is, who?

*Intro Sequence Starts*

Cinta: There were only four other people who could’ve possibly spotted us when the crime took place — because it is a crime.

Our friend Nadine, who was sitting right next to us when the crime had happened, but swore an oath to not speak of it to anyone else. 

And 3 other people, Lovely, Karen, and Milano, who were in a totally different friend group, that we happened to run into.

All of which deny having any involvement in this crime or told anyone of what they had witnessed.

**Some huge title here about having four suspects**

Karen: *laughs smugly while shaking her head*

Nadine: I would never, you know. I was already used to seeing them together and I would never jeopardise my friendship with Jason and Cinta. I’m one of Jason’s closest friends for Christ’s sake.

Jason: You know, we didn’t know what to do; but luckily we didn’t have to go through this tragedy alone. We had a few connections and managed to get some help.

Evan: Uh yeah; I’m Evan — and I’m a retired police detective.

Immediately, everything’s like “What is going on here?!”

Jason: It was like they were mocking me, or something.

“Yeah, we saw you together”, and we even spread it around — we know you would hate that.

Evan: We’re dealing with truly sick individuals.

Lovely: This is absolutely ridiculous. I don’t even know these people.

Jason: The person who did this clearly knew that our grade is filled with drama and romance deprived prepubescent teens just waiting for their next victim. And in this case, I was unlucky enough to be one of the victims.

Tristan: I mean really, what kind of sick person would do that purposely?

## SCENE C - ARGUMENTS

*the group is arguing and shouting to each other*

Cinta: Just admit it, Vely. We know you did it. It’s better to end this now.

Lovely: No! That’s enough. I’m not listening to this anymore.

Jason: You guys are just the same as those students who are sexually attracted to drama.

Milano: I’m not sexually attracted to drama, asshole!

Karen: I’ve heard enough. I’m leaving.

Milano: It was so obvious after all, you guys were literally streaming together for two hours!

Jason: It’s why your dad left you.

Lovely: *starts crying*

I’m sorry, this is too much.

*walks off frame*
	
## SCENE D - LAST MOMENTS

Evan: The culprit would be called a rebuttal.

Jovan: There’s only 4 other people in this time frame.

Jason: I’m losing hope, I don’t know how we can find the culprit at this point. But for now, we can’t trust anyone just yet.

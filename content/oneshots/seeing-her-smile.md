The night was a shade of denim, the stars peeking through the dark clouds and a full moon blooming in the sky. Jason and Cinta took a detour from their campus path to walk through the beach near their campus. The moon gave enough light for the two to be able to see the sea from shore.

“Just take off your shoes, Jas. The sand on your toes are the best part of being in the beach.” Cinta sits down on the pavement and takes off her shoes and socks, holding on to them before stepping onto the cold white soft grains of sand, kicking it around a bit before motioning her hand to get Jason to take his shoes off. Jason hesitantly removes his shoes, holding onto them aswell before putting one foot on the sandy shore. 

Cinta starts running around the sand, almost tripping a few times but couldn’t stop laughing the whole time. Jason slowly followed behind her, never really being a huge fan of beaches, but really enjoyed being alone with Cinta on the beach, seeing her smile. Jason soon followed playing around the sand with Cinta as if they were children, not having a single care in those moments and feeling like it was them against the whole world. 

After a while, they got tired and sat down by the shore, just enough to get their feet wet from the slow tides rising. Cinta still smiled warmly, looking straight at the water. They were too tired to say anything, but knew that this moment was one to last. Cinta decided to rest her head on Jason’s shoulder, while Jason slightly tilts his head towards hers. The sound of water splashing, along with the windy breeze gave a chill down their backs, but being next to each other warmed them up, especially when Jason decides to place his hand on Cinta’s waist to keep each other close.

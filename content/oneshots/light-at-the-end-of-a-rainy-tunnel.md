The rain kept pouring outside of Jason’s dorm, thunder lightly clashing every few minutes, while Jason laid in his bed with a slight feeling of despair knowing the pouring rain won’t stop until at least nightfall. He grabbed his phone from the study desk right next to his twin bed, opening his chats with Cinta to text her that they have to cancel their plans to go on a walk together. 

“Sorry, Cin. The rain is pretty big and won’t stop for hours so might as well cancel. Maybe next time?” Jason sighs, switching positions to face his ceiling, filled with disappointed to know he won’t be able to spend time with an amazing girl before putting his phone back on the table. But just a few seconds after sending that text, slowly closing his eyes to sleep off the sound of thunder, frantic knocks on his door cause Jason to go into fight-or-flight mode, getting up from his bed and opening his dorm room door.

Jason’s expression quickly turns to shock, seeing a soaking wet Cinta holding a broken umbrella. Her light grey coat dripped with rain water, her hair messed up from the wind and rainfall, breathing heavily like she had just ran inside the dormitory hall from the opposite side of the campus just to visit him. The two just looked at each other, smiling a bit for a few seconds. Cinta raised a plastic bag with warm Chinese takeout she bought near campus, smiling warmly as if she forgot she was just running from a thunderstorm. “Takeout?”

Jason immediately invited her in, letting her borrow his hoodie and a pair of shorts while he washed her clothes in his washing machine. The two grabbed some chopsticks and laid out all the food she bought. Even though they couldn’t go on their walk, they were pretty satisfied with how the day ended, right next to each other watching TV while eating warm takeout with the sound of rain in the background.

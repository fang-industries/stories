Jason sat down in his usual seat in his class, waiting for his professor to start the class. He pulls out his laptop and opens the notes from the last lecture, reviewing what he wrote just incase his professor gives a sudden pop quiz. He ends up pulling out his phone to update his friends.

“Can’t believe we’ve been reviewing the same material over and over again. At least today a new student is being introduced so something interesting actually happens.”

Jason texts to his group chat consisting of Evan and Nadine. Despite going to different Universities, they all still keep in touch since they all go to universities based in Jakarta (except for Nadine, she’s in Banten lol). Evan goes to Binawan University since he is a Physics major, and Nadine goes to UMN to pursue Graphic Design.

Van why did you even pursue physics its basically middle school abuse, bio or chem is a thousand times better and less abusive to the adolescent mind.

Jason shuts off his phone and places it in his bag, looking at his laptop as his professor walks into the classroom.

“Good evening, class. As I announced yesterday, there will be a new student joining us. It appears she is a bit tardy at the moment so let us start with opening our textbooks at page 15-“

The professor’s words were cut when a girl wearing a grey hoodie with jeans walk in. “I’m so sorry I’m late, professor, the traffic was a nightmare.”

“No worries, Anastasia. You are right on time. Go ahead and sit next to Jason in the back.”

Jason didn’t pay attention to who it was and was busy with his computer.

“You can call me Cinta, sir. Anastasia is just my first name.”

This one sentence immediately caught Jason’s attention.

“Cinta?”

“Jason?”

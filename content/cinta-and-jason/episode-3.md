Jason and Cinta soon got closer, sat next to each other everyday and studied together. They got along well after only 3 days, but they were always texting, calling or studying together, just like old times.

Jovan walks into the class and sits on the left from Jason, since Cinta was already at his right. Their class starts and the day continued normally, but for Jovan, it was an easy target to make fun of Jason.

“I’ve got a different class after this. Do you still want to study at the main hall tonight?” Cinta asked Jason, packing her laptop and notebooks into her totebag.

“Jas, now’s the time to ask her about dinner!” Jovan whispers to Jason, but Jason couldn’t say anything. He just stuttered a goodbye before Cinta walked away.

“I couldn’t do it, bro. It’s too early. Plus I’m worried it’ll be awkward.” Jason just closed his textbook and packed it in, not looking at Jovan.

“If you’re not doing this, then I’ll have to help.” Jovan walks over to Cinta who was still at the door, asking her about dinner between the 3 of them. Jason couldn’t hear what Jovan said, but saw Cinta smile and nod before walking away. When Cinta was out of earshot, they both were filled with excitement, of course planning for Jovan to cancel last minute. “I don’t want to third-wheel, so I’ll just give an excuse to not join.”

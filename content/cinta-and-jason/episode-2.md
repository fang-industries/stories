“How long has it been? I feel like it’s been ages since we last spoke.”

Cinta set her bag down on the table and sat down next to Jason, pulling out her laptop and textbook. She had a sweet smile on her face, the same one that made Jason crush on her in middle school. Jason wanted to say something but was stunned, his mouth open ready to answer her question but couldn’t get his eyes off her smile.

“It’s been about 3 years since we last saw each other. We were in the same class since 8th grade but parted ways and grew apart in 10th grade.” Jason looked at Cinta with a soft smile, unknowingly staring at her for a few minutes. He moved his focus on to his work instead, but he couldn’t seem to gather any of the information from the lecture.

### What would Fang Industries be like as a family?

For context, we're a middle class family, without any severe money issues.

**The family goes as following:**

- Jason, a 17 year old guy; is usually emotional and has a secret artistic side.
- Evan, being 15 years old; is introverted at times, but opens up to people he's close to. He's great at dealing with emotional situations and supporting people he cares about.
- Timothy, fully matured at 22, he's the only one who has a job. He'll play games on his free time to cool off, and is introverted.
- Nicholas, the troublemaker, is 12 and loves playing games with his other siblings.
- Antonio, the youngest, is 10 and loves playing Minecraft.
- Jovannes, 14, plays a lot of games with his siblings, and is very outgoing with his close friends.
- Tristan, 13, absolutely loves hanging out with friends a lot; whenever someone he cares about vents to him, he perfectly sympathises with them and tries to support them.
- Brigitta, the older sister, 15, is great at supporting people she cares about. She is often over-protective over her siblings and will beat anyone up who tried to hurt her siblings.
- Albert, who is also 14, is Jovannes' twin, although they have drastically different hobbies.
- Nadine, the younger sister, 13, likes hanging out with her friends; and is usually mean to the people she cares about, as her love language.

### To start this off, we have Jason

He's one of the oldest in the family, being 16. Jason is quite a sarcastic person, but when you get to know him he'll talk and joke around with you. He's quite an emotional roller-coaster himself, being very fragile, and having little to no control over his emotions.

Jason is passionate, kind and has a secret artistic side. He may seem cool and chill, but he's low-key sensitive and want people to talk to him. He'll do almost whatever for the people they love, but may not be appreciated all the time.

He often overthinks over the smallest things and thinks he's doing something wrong, when in reality he isn't. He loves being reassured and loved but feels as if he could never be and that if he ever was, people would try to ruin his relationship.

He has been through a lot of tough times, but with the help of his siblings, are able to get through all of them. If you ever go out with Jason, be prepared for "I love you so much" every single day.

### Up next, Evan!

Evan is one of the bestest friends anyone could ever have. He's joyful, caring, and is a nice person. He's pretty smart, but can also act very silly. It might not seem like it, but he is very smart. He can be such a big idiot, but that's what makes him special.

His humour clicks with you and can always make you laugh, even in the darkest times. He may seem weird to people who don't know him, his close friends know that he is completely insane, but it's great. It's fun to be around him. He's a friend that will always be there for you no matter what.

If you're in pain, he'll make you feel better and forget you were ever in pain with his silly dumb jokes. When you hug him, you immediately feel safe and at home. He makes being loved the greatest feeling in the world, and never fails to make someone happy. He's the most loving, selfless, kind-hearted, caring, and respectful guy anyone would be lucky enough to know.

### Now, enter Timothy.

Being the oldest in the family, he's the one with a stable 9-to-5 job and supports the whole family financially with his income. He doesn't make a lot of money, but he makes enough money to keep the whole family and himself happy.

To support the family, he also relies on Jason to keep him sane. Jason supports him by helping around the house, taking care of the kids, and making their breakfast for the day. While he's gone for the day, Jason stays at home; working with his remote tech job.

He departs to his monotone, boring, 9-to-5 job as an accountant at 10 o'clock, and sighs as he begs for a change. When he gets home, he sits down at the porch and ponders what he's done wrong to be in this situation.

Timothy is often lonely and sad, and has trouble finding a significant other. He's an incredibly good friend and wingman; but is often left out when it comes to happiness or love, but enjoys spending his time making others happy.

### Moving on to Nicholas.

Nicholas doesn't really have the best track record in the family, raging at every game he loses and making a bunch of noise. He keeps the house awake with his keyboard clicks at night playing _osu!_.

He tries to help out his siblings, but sometimes he pushes the offer a bit too much, to the point it becomes annoying. His constant pranks and jokes can make for a good time, and can make him the subject of the majority's scorn or dislike.

Although he may come off as a jerk to some at times, and his jokes may be inappropriate, there's a compassionate gentleman inside; and is simply what makes Nicholas, himself. He's great at playing the piano and enjoys playing pieces for people he cares about.

### Moving right along to Antonio...

Being the youngest in the family, he doesn't have a single responsibility and plays _Minecraft_ all day. He wakes up and goes to school each day, making rap battles everyday with his friends at the canteen and always talks about how he hates school.

He doesn't have any problems in life and doesn't give a damn about what goes on in the family. He's usually stubborn and doesn't like going to sleep early; and is incredibly lazy and his room smells like potato chips and the smell of mountain dew.

### Now, clap for Jovannes!

Jovannes is the most amazing guy you'll ever meet. Out of everyone here, he has the most beautiful eyes and a smile that'll light up your world even at the darkest times. He has a kind heart and is usually nice to everyone. His love is unconditional and he's a great listener.

He's very smart, but he can sometimes act like a know-it all. He's a huge geography nerd and knows at least one fact about almost every country. Although he under-performs in school, he's extremely passionate about the things he loves learning about. Simply put, he likes learning at his own pace, about the topics he's passionate about.

Jovannes will always be there for you; supporting you every step of the way, no matter how ridiculous it is. He's a great person to talk and vent to, and tries to help out whenever possible. Although he may sometimes be a tease, shipping you with people you like; it's impossible to hate him for that because he's a genuinely great guy.

### Moving right along to Tristan...

Tristan, being the average 13-year-old he is, he enjoys playing games all day and going out with his friends all day. His genuine smile happens very rarely, and only happens when he's enjoying his time with his friends or siblings.

He's an amazing guy who will keep you laughing no matter what. He seems shy at first, but when you really get to know him, he's really cool. He acts gay around his friends, but is actually straight. He tends to bring himself down often, so you should be there to help him out and make him feel better.

Tristan will put up with your crap no matter what, and will always be there to support you. He perfectly sympathises with you when you're venting to him, and will always make you feel safe and will always put you in a good mood. He may argue with you, but he'll usually just make a joke out of the argument, or will apologise. No matter how you feel, Tristan will always be there for you to talk to.

### Going right to Brigitta.

According to a lot of people, she's the ultimate package there is: beauty and the brains. Brigitta may seem all innocent, but piss her off, and watch the devil come out of her. She always usually hides her feelings; and when you see her cry, it's because she couldn't handle the pain anymore.

She's friends with everyone from the popular group to pretty much the bottom. She knows everyone and makes friends easily. She also keeps those friends no matter what. She's nice, sweet, and funny. She does have her fair share of secrets. Everyone thinks she's a happy, perky girl but truly, she's breaking inside.

Brigitta will be there for you when you need her, and is a good listener. She's the one keeping Jason sane out of all the emotional wreckage he's going through. She always defends her siblings without hesitation, and is willing to beat anyone up who tries to hurt her siblings.

### Now to Jovan's twin: Albert!

Albert often gets along with people really easily, and he's comfortable with himself and the position they are in. Although, he's very fragile, sometimes crying in a lot of cases. Apart from that, he's one of the most thoughtful and kind person there can be.

He usually helps out all his friends and siblings and give selfishly, not expecting anything in return. In addition, he's really fun and smart, and great with animals. Apart from that, he's also musically gifted and is a talented genius. He's an absolute perfectionist, especially to his passion for music.

He can uphold his values really well, even when everyone around him does otherwise. He is fiercely loyal and protective of the people he loves, like that of a lion, protecting his lair. He is extremely intelligent and articulate and can use his words like a sword if he needs to do so. He knows and sees things that the average person may miss.

### Onto to our baby sister, Nadine.

She may seem mean at first, always hitting her siblings and friends, but that's her love language. On a more serious note though, however, she always manages to comfort the people she cares about and makes you feel like you're cared for and at home.

She brings joy and light to life, and treats people so sweetly like everyone is her own. Everyone loves her, even if she doesn't believe it. Even on bad days, she manages to bring out the best in everyone and see some of the inspiring light in her.

Her smile lights up the room, and are wonderful storytellers and born entertainers. She never lets you down and is always there when you need someone to talk to. Don't let her beauty get to your head however, as she can be very sassy.

On a more professional side, she free-lances and creates art as her side job, to support the family with a bit more income. She always tries to help whenever possible, and is willing to sacrifice to keep everyone else happy.

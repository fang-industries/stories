### Good morning, lads!

The day begins with Jason opening the door and calling everyone to get up. Evan, with his eyes barely opened covers his head with his pillow. Before he could fall asleep, he gets tickled by Jason and is awoken, really pissed though.

He finally manages to gather enough strength to get up and shower, and gets dressed in his school uniform in a rush. "Beau'iful day today, innit?", he says while mocking the British accent. The others just raise an eyebrow at him, in confusion.

Evan packs his bag in a hurry, and goes downstairs to eat a slice of left-over pizza. He takes a quick look at his notes while waiting for Tim to start up the car; he has a big test today and he wants to make sure he's prepared. At last, he finally gets ready for school and puts on his shoes.

### A stressful test awaits

He enters the class and is swarmed by people asking for yesterday's homework answers. Being the goody two shoes he is, he turns down everyone. School starts with a boring literature class, where everyone's distracted. The teacher relies on Evan to make everyone pay attention, although he doesn't seem to bother doing so.

The test begins, everyone sweats off struggling while Evan scans through with a breeze and pass with flying colours. As usual, Evan gets the award for the top student. Feeling great, he goes calling everyone saying they have a major skill issue, like the brat he is.

### Nom-nom-nom time

Lunch break comes. A group of people approach him and pins him to the seat. They tease him and threatens to hurt him if he doesn't handover his notes for tomorrow's exam. He reluctantly gives them the note.

Bri walks in and witnesses this. She readies her fist and blows a punch to the bully's face, giving them a black eye. The rest of the bullies laughs at the injured guy for falling.

"Back off, you little cunt. Only I'm allowed to bully my siblings.", she said fiercely.

"Oh, thanks.", he whispered. He then runs off.

### Back to class

The lunch bell rings. He goes to his last class of the day, physics. Physics class goes smoothly, since it was his favourite subject. Time goes really fast without Evan realising. As he gets snapped back to reality, the school bell rings and it's time to go home.

He packs up his bag and waves goodbye to his teacher and friends. As he goes down the stairs, headed for the computer lab; he pulls out his phone and receives a text from Jason.

_"yo, wait at the lab as usual, ill be out at 4 today, gotta study lmao"_

"ok", he responds.

Evan waits, and waits. Eventually he gets tired and decides to go to a local mini-market to grab something to drink. He sees Bri there, too, also picking up something to drink.

"Bri? You're here too?", he asks.

"Oh, hey!", she responds.

"Thanks for defending me earlier, again. I appreciate it.", says Evan.

"Nah, don't worry about it, it's nothing.", Bri laughs it off.

"Anyways, you wanna go over and tease Jason at the library?", Evan says while giggling.

"Sure!", Bri says excitedly.

### Time to get out of school

So both of them go on to Jason's high-school library and pulls a prank on him. The librarian kicks them out for disturbing the peace. Jason, realising he lost track of time, swiftly gets out of the library and gets to his car.

"Bri? Evan? What are you guys doing here?", he asked.

"Uhh, we got kicked out of your library because we tried to pull a prank on you.", Bri said.

Jason laughs it off and says, "Oh, you cheeky buggers."

"Alright, let's go pick up the others now.", says Jason.

"Jason don't forget to pick up the others for Badminton alright?" Evan asks.

"Alright, alright." Jason responds.

### Hitting cocks

Jason drops him, Albert and Jovan off at badminton practice. "Have fun, y'all", he yells before the three boys went in. Even though Evan doesn't excel at other sports, he has a passion for badminton and loves playing it.

Today however, was a really bad day; a shuttlecock hits him in the eye. "OUCH!", he exclaimed.

"You okay bro?", Jovan asks.

Albert runs over and gives him an ice pack. "Here, put this on your eye. It'll help you feel better.", said Albert.

"Oh, thanks.", Evan responds.

The rest of badminton practice goes smoothly, except for the fact that he's holding an ice pack on his eye all the time. Of course, his siblings poke fun at him, for any other reason other than he looks goofed.

### Back to home

As Jason is picking the rest of the boys up, he gets concerned when he saw Evan holding an ice pack on his eye.

"What the fuck happened?", he asked.

"His eye got hit by a shuttlecock!", Albert said while laughing.

"L — massive skill issue", Jason responded.

"Can we just go home?", Evan replied whilst sounding annoyed, rolling his eyes.

The boys arrive home safely. Evan goes to the bathroom and takes a shower right away. After that, he puts on his clothes and unpacks his bag. He gets on his computer for a match of League of Legends. It's been a long day today, and he needs to unwind.

### Everyone misses Tim, a lot

"Dinner's ready!", Jason yelled.

"What about Tim? Is he eating with us tonight?" Evan asks.

"No — he says he'll be home at 11 today.", Jason responds.

_Evan sighs._

Tristan: "I wish he could be here with us."

Nicholas, with an annoyed tone: "Does he even care about us?".

Jason: "Of course he does. No doubt."

Nadine: "For real though, why does he always come home late? It's as if he purposefully avoids us."

Jason: "It's because he always works overtime, just to provide us enough money for food."

Jason: "He cares a lot about us, don't ever doubt that."

"Hmph." Nicholas responds with a pissed tone.

Bri: "Let's eat now; shall we?"

Jason: "Cheers everyone! Let's eat."

They have a great dinner, although, they miss Tim a lot.

After dinner, Evan goes to his room and packs for the next day. It's been a long day today, but a bright day awaits him tomorrow. Before he goes to sleep, he texts Tim a good night, although he rarely responds.

"Goodnight, everyone" Evan says before closing his eye and dozing off.

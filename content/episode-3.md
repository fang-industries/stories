### School life

The bell rings, Jason packs up his books from Math Class and heads to the library to prepare for tomorrow's exam. He jams to Fiji Blue and starts to take notes. To prepare for tomorrow's exam, he decides to skip French Class, even with much reluctance.

Even with a good academic reputation, he feels as if there's an empty void in him, an unexplainable feeling of emptiness fills his heart, as his life he has rarely socialized, only being close to people who are already close to him and never seeking to find new friends.

Suddenly, Jason feels a rough hit to his back. It's his siblings, Evan and Bri. They tease being a nerd, studying all the time. Jason, obviously pissed, tells them to go away. They continue laughing at him but in the end, they still give him encouragement.

It's becoming a habit of them three.

### The end of school

4 o'clock rolls in, Jason packs up and comes over to Evan and Bri's class. They go to his car and pick up their siblings. Antonio and Nicholas walks home together since their elementary school is a 5 minute walk from their apartment. Jason goes to the middle school section of the school and pickup the rest of the siblings. Of course, Jovan and Albert are late as they were playing sports in the school field.

### The drive home

Jason drives Evan, Jovan, and Albert to Badminton practice and Nadine to her swimming courses; while the rest arrives home and takes a well needed rest. Jason goes straight to the kitchen and starts preparing dinner for them. He orders Bri to watch over the chicken broth while Jason goes to pick up the rest.

### Life at home

As Tim isn't home most of the time, the kids see Jason as a parental figure; although, Evan and Jovan doesn't seem too fond of that. Things go smooth, the kids eat dinner and watch a movie together.

It's now nine o'clock, Jason tucks everyone to bed and he does his coding commissions for around two hours, before he falls asleep on the couch because of exhaustion. It's been a stressful day for him.

### Noises

Jason was awoken by the creak of the front door being opened. He limps his way to the porch to find Tim opening the door, looking all pale from exhaustion.

“Tim?”, he asks.

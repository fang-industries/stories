### Good morning!

It's 5:00 AM. Tim's alarm blares as he suddenly wakes up, feeling bogged, he washes his face and gets ready for work. He wakes up Jason and proceeds to prepare the kids' breakfast. As Jason is packing their meals, he microwaves last night's pizza and wakes up everyone and hand them the plate of pizza.

He starts his Honda, and warms up the vehicle. As he waits for everyone to get ready, he plugs in his phone to the car, and jams to Porter Robinson in the car, relating to the lyrics; in hope of a change.

On his trip to the office, he gets stuck at the highway; he slams his hand on to the steering wheel with rage as he curses out harsh profanity to the car infront. He gulps down the rest of the coffee, turn up his music and drives the wrong lane as a shortcut. He pushes down the pedal and drives in to the right lane.

### A stressful afternoon awaits

After the debacle, he finally arrives at the office at 9:30, and sits down in his cubicle desk. His manager drops him a stack of paper and orders him to compile them in to an Excel spreadsheet by the end of the day. He groans and slams the table once more, while secretly wishing death upon his own manager. Even with rage, he does his work voluntarily with silence.

Lunch break at last, he rushes down the elevator and grabs a footlong sandwich. He scarves the sandwich down with speed and takes a sip of another cup of coffee. Then he gets back to work to his cubicle

### End of day

Work ends at 20:00 after overtime. he walks out of the office and breathes a sigh of relief. He walks to his car and goes to the diner across to get some dinner. He wishes for a day where he can have some one to sit across the table to talk to, but such a fantasy seems impossible to him.

He arrives back at home, late at 11 o'clock, feeling anguished and exhausted after the long day. He makes sure everyone is asleep before sitting on the front porch, admiring the city skylines from a view. He breaks in to a slight tear, wishing he would escape his infinite cycle of hell. He sighs and is about to walk back until...

### Wholesome brother-hood

Jason walks in the porch â€” "You good Tim? Why are you here? Shouldn't you be asleep?", he asks.

"Oh, it's nothing, don't worry. You should go back to sleep", Tim responds.

Jason: _"I can clearly see you in tears, Tim. Just tell me what's wrong."_

Tim: _"I... just want to feel free."_

Tim: _"Everyday, I go through my job. 5 to 11, sometimes I feel I just wanna collapse and curl up in to tears. But I know I can't do that, because then there would be no-one to take care of you guys, and you all, mean the world to me."_

Tim: _"Do me a favour please, take care of your brothers and sisters if I am gone, okay? It's the only thing I'm asking for."_

Jason: _"Of course dude, I promise."_

Tim: _"Thank you so much. I appreciate it."_

Jason reaches in for a hug, comforting Tim in the process.

Jason whispers an "I love you, bro" in Tim's ears, he lets out a tear in his left eye knowing that deep down, he already has everything he wants.

Tim heads off to bed, feeling comforted in a way he hasn't felt in a long, long time.

Goodnight, world.
